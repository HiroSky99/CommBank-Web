# Task 2: Modify an Existing React/Redux Frontend

## Task Overview

- **What you'll learn**
  - Extend an existing React/Redux frontend using TypeScript.
  - Modify and update data models (Goal model) in a React/Redux environment.
  - Integrate and implement an emoji picker into a React application.
  - Gain practical experience with React components, Redux store, TypeScript, NPM, and Git version control.

- **What you'll do**
  - Fork and set up the rWEB repository.
  - Start the web app in development mode.
  - Update the client’s goal model to include icons and display them on goal cards.
  - Implement an emoji picker and modify the Goal manager for users to add/change icons and submit the code file containing these changes.

## Here is the background information on your task

This task will onboard you to rWEB. To support icons, we need to extend our existing React/Redux frontend written in TypeScript. You'll start by cloning the repo and installing its dependencies. Then, you will modify the Goal model using TypeScript, integrate an emoji picker and lastly, extend the existing React components and Redux store to enable users to add and change icons. Again, eventually you will use git to share your work. But for now, upload a file with your changes to GoalManager.tsx.
